### Discription
In order to drive your car safely, you have to have a reliable braking system. Modern vehicles use several components in conjunction with one another to successfully slow and stop moving cars, especially when they travel at high speeds.Brake rotors are used alongside other braking components to slow and stop your vehicle. Without brake rotors, your vehicle would not be able to stop safely or slow down after acceleration, aside from gradual slowing due to friction with the air and the road itself.
Your vehicle also has brake pads that clamp down on your wheels to stop them from spinning. For context, the rotors are the surfaces those pads press down upon. They are typically made of iron, so they maintain long-term durability. But although they are durable by default, brake rotors still require maintenance and replacement from time to time.


### 1. Brake rotors begin working as soon as you step on your brake pedal. When you depress your brake pedal, the brake pads compress against the rotors. Keep in mind; there’s one rotor installed per wheel on your car. When you brake, all four wheels slow down in unison.

### 2 . As the brake pads press down on the brake rotors, friction is applied, which progressively slows down the rotation of your car’s wheels (provided you are not still pressing down on the accelerator). The process of slowing your wheels through friction naturally creates intense heat.

### 3 . Drilled rotors have a series of holes drilled in spiraling patterns across the surface. The holes assist with heat dissemination and allow dust and water to escape the rotor’s surface without clogging or damaging the overall braking system.

### 4 . Slotted rotors have special slots positioned around the exterior rotor surface instead of holes. Slotted rotors are often used with heavy-duty trucks and heavy SUVs, as these larger and heavier vehicles typically require more stopping power. Slotted rotors are also preferred for individuals who use their cars to tow heavy loads frequently.

### 5 . Brake rotors are important components in your car’s overall braking system. Be sure to pay attention to how they perform and how responsive your braking action is so you can replace them when necessary. Don’t hesitate to ask a mechanic which rotor type is best for your vehicle and driving habits when picking out new rotors.
